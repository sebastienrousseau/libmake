## Overview üìñ

`LibMake` is a tool designed to quickly help creating high-quality Rust
libraries by generating a set of pre-filled and pre-defined templated
files. This opinionated boilerplate scaffolding tool aims to greatly
reduces development time and minimizes repetitive tasks, allowing you to
focus on your business logic while enforcing standards, best practices,
consistency, and providing style guides for your library.

With `LibMake`, you can easily generate a new Rust library code base
structure with all the necessary files, layouts, build configurations,
code, tests, benchmarks, documentation, and much more in a matter of
seconds.

The library is designed to be used as a command-line tool. It is
available on [Crates.io][7] and [Lib.rs][8].

## Features ‚ú®

`LibMake` offers the following features and benefits:

- Create your Rust library with ease using the command line interface or
  by providing a configuration file in CSV, JSON, TOML, or YAML format.
- Rapidly generate new library projects with a pre-defined structure and
  boilerplate code that you can customize with your own template.
- Generate a library pre-defined GitHub Actions workflow to help you
  automate your library development and testing.
- Automatically generate basic functions, methods, and macros to get you
  started with your Rust library.
- Enforce best practices and standards with starter documentation, test
  suites, and benchmark suites that are designed to help you get up and
  running quickly.

## Getting Started üöÄ

It takes just a few seconds to get up and running with `LibMake`.

### Installation

To install `LibMake`, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed on
your machine. You can install the Rust toolchain by following the
instructions on the [Rust website][13].

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install `LibMake`
using the following command:

```shell
cargo install libmake
```

You can then run the help command to see the available options:

```shell
libmake --help
```

### Requirements

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust `1.69.0`
or later (stable).

### Platform support

`LibMake` is supported and has been tested on the following platforms:

The [GitHub Actions][10] shows the platforms in which the `LibMake`
library tests are run.

Should you encounter any issues with the library on any of the above
platforms, please [report a bug][3]. We will do our best to resolve the
issue as soon as possible. If you would like to contribute to help us to
support additional platforms, please submit a pull request.

## Usage üìñ

### Command-line interface

`LibMake` provides a command-line interface to generate a new library
project. There are a few options available to help you get started.

#### Generate a new library using a CSV file

The following command generates a library template from a CSV file.

Have a look at the `tests/data/mylibrary.csv` file for an example and
feel free to use it for your own library as a template.

```shell
libmake --csv tests/data/mylibrary.csv
```

or locally if you have cloned the repository:

```shell
cargo run -- --csv tests/data/mylibrary.csv
```

#### Generate a new library using a JSON file

The following command generates a library template from a JSON file.

Have a look at the `tests/data/mylibrary.json` file for an example and
feel free to use it for your own library as a template.

```shell
libmake --json tests/data/mylibrary.json
```

or locally if you have cloned the repository:

```shell
cargo run -- --json tests/data/mylibrary.json
```

#### Generate a new library using a TOML file

The following command generates a library template from a TOML file.

Have a look at the `tests/data/mylibrary.toml` file for an example and
feel free to use it for your own library as a template.

```shell
libmake --toml tests/data/mylibrary.toml
```

or locally if you have cloned the repository:

```shell
cargo run -- --toml tests/data/mylibrary.toml
```

#### Generate a new library using a YAML file

The following command generates a library template from a YAML file.

Have a look at the `tests/data/mylibrary.yaml` file for an example and
feel free to use it for your own library as a template.

```shell
libmake --yml tests/data/mylibrary.yaml
```

or locally if you have cloned the repository:

```shell
cargo run -- --yml tests/data/mylibrary.yaml
```

#### Generate a new library using the command-line interface (CLI) directly

The following command generates a library template using the command-line
interface.

```shell
libmake \
    --author "John Smith" \
    --build "build.rs" \
    --categories "['category 1', 'category 2', 'category 3']" \
