## Features ‚ú®

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3

## Getting Started üöÄ

It takes just a few minutes to get up and running with `{name}`.

### Installation

To install `{name}`, you need to have the Rust toolchain installed on
your machine. You can install the Rust toolchain by following the
instructions on the [Rust website][13].

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can install `{name}`
using the following command:

```shell
cargo install {name}
```

You can then run the help command to see the available options:

```shell
{name} --help
```

### Requirements

The minimum supported Rust toolchain version is currently Rust
**{rustversion}** or later (stable).

### Platform support

`{name}` is supported and tested on the following platforms:

#### Linux targets üêß

| Target | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu | 64-bit Linux systems on ARM architecture | ‚úÖ |
| aarch64-unknown-linux-musl | 64-bit Linux systems on ARM architecture | ‚úÖ |
| arm-unknown-linux-gnueabi | ARMv6 Linux (kernel 3.2, glibc 2.17) | ‚úÖ |
| armv7-unknown-linux-gnueabihf | ARMv7 Linux, hardfloat (kernel 3.2, glibc 2.17) | ‚úÖ |
| i686-unknown-linux-gnu | 32-bit Linux (kernel 3.2+, glibc 2.17+) | ‚úÖ |
| i686-unknown-linux-musl | 32-bit Linux (kernel 3.2+, musl libc) | ‚úÖ |
| x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu | 64-bit Linux (kernel 2.6.32+, glibc 2.11+) | ‚úÖ |
| x86_64-unknown-linux-musl | 64-bit Linux (kernel 2.6.32+, musl libc) | ‚úÖ |

#### macOS targets üçé

| Target | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x86_64-apple-darwin | 64-bit macOS (10.7 Lion or later) | ‚úÖ |

The [GitHub Actions][10] shows the platforms in which the `{name}`
library tests are run.

### Documentation
