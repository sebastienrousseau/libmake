## Overview ðŸ“–

`LibMake` is a tool designed to quickly help creating high-quality Rust libraries by generating a set of pre-filled and pre-defined templated files. This opinionated boilerplate scaffolding tool aims to greatly reduces development time and minimizes repetitive tasks, allowing you to focus on your business logic while enforcing standards, best practices, consistency, and providing style guides for your library.

With `LibMake`, you can easily generate a new Rust library code base structure with all the necessary files, layouts, build configurations, code, tests, benchmarks, documentation, and much more in a matter of seconds.

The library is designed to be used as a command-line tool. It is available on [Crates.io][05] and [Lib.rs][06].

## Features âœ¨

`LibMake` offers the following features and benefits:

- Create your Rust library with ease using the command line interface or by providing a configuration file in CSV, JSON, TOML, or YAML format.
- Rapidly generate new library projects with a pre-defined structure and boilerplate code that you can customize with your own template.
- Generate a library pre-defined GitHub Actions workflow to help you automate your library development and testing.
- Automatically generate basic functions, methods, and macros to get you started with your Rust library.
- Enforce best practices and standards with starter documentation, test suites, and benchmark suites that are designed to help you get up and running quickly.
