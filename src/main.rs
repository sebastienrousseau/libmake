//! # Libmake Application
//!
//! This is the main entry point for the `libmake` application. It provides a simple command-line
//! interface to execute the functionality provided by the `libmake` crate.
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! The purpose of this application is to serve as the entry point for the `libmake` functionality.
//! It calls the `run` function from the `libmake` crate to execute the desired tasks.
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! To use the `libmake` application, you can include it as part of your Rust project.
//! The main function of the application calls the `run` function from the `libmake` module.
//! If an error occurs during execution, it prints an error message and exits with a non-zero status code.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libmake::run;
//!
//!/ This is the main entry point for the libmake application.
//! Call the `run()` function from the `libmake` module.
//! if let Err(ref e) = run() {
//!     eprintln!("Error running libmake: {}", e);
//!     std::process::exit(1);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This application allows you to interact with and use the functionality provided by the `libmake` crate.

use libmake::run;
use std::env;

fn main() {
    // Combined check for "xtask" and execution of associated task
    let found_xtask = env::args_os().any(|arg| arg == "xtask");
    if found_xtask {
        if let Err(e) = xtasks::tasks::ci::CIBuilder::default().run() {
            eprintln!("Error executing CI task: {e}");
            std::process::exit(1);
        }
    }
    else {
        match run() {
            Ok(_) => println!("Program completed successfully."),
            Err(e) => eprintln!("Program encountered an error: {}", e),
        }
    }
